# Rectangle-Based Layout Description

The annotated screenshot highlights a portion of a food ordering interface structured around rectangular cards and controls:

- Two product cards sit side by side within bold green outlines. Each card features a breakfast item composed of a tortilla and eggs, accompanied by descriptive text, price, and action buttons.
- Within each green rectangle, a thinner red rectangle surrounds the photograph of the meal, emphasizing the round tortilla served on a small plate. The left card also shows a sausage link and salsa, while the right card displays only the tortilla.
- Orange circular arrow buttons appear on the far left and right of the frame, suggesting horizontal carousel navigation between menu items.
- At the bottom of each card, a pale cream panel contains quantity controls with orange “Agregar” (add) and “Quitar” (remove) buttons. Beneath the panel, a wide green rectangle encloses the text “En carrito: 0,” indicating the current cart count for the item.
- A purple plus symbol positioned near the bottom right corner and a matching minus symbol near the bottom left corner likely mark the areas associated with adjusting the quantity controls.

Overall, the rectangles draw attention to the layout hierarchy—product imagery, pricing, and cart interactions—within the breakfast menu carousel.
